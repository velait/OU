Repository for the source files required to compile the notebook for StanCon 2018 Helsinki submission. 

Running the entire script from scratch takes a long time (hours on a basic laptop). For this reason the most time consuming parts in OU.source.R have been
commented. The files not generated by the available version can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15kd6Y2CgoXEH6y0mqEU4YRLR4i_fTTrk?usp=sharing. If you wish to generate these files yourself
simply uncomment the rows 58-65, 91-95, 144-14 and 206-213 in source.R.

To create the report in html format unzip the downloaded files and run the script hierarchical_OU.main.Rmd.
