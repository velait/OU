# OU
Running the entire script from scratch takes a long time (hours). For this reason the most time consuming parts in OU.source.R have been
commented. The files not generated by the available version can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15kd6Y2CgoXEH6y0mqEU4YRLR4i_fTTrk?usp=sharing. If you wish to generate these files yourself
simply uncomment rows 38-43, 64-65, 106-115 in source.R.

To create the report in html format unzip the downloaded files and run the script main.OU.Rmd.
